* Duplicate companies can still be added if you hit save twice before navigating away (might only be on first run?)
* Alerts / notifications should happen in app instead of at the system level.
* You can add a company and a project for that company at the same time (i.e. the company must already exist in the DB), even though you can do it in the UI.
* Missing all sorts of unit, integration, and smoke tests.
* The report screen is still blank. It should be reading from the reporting view.
