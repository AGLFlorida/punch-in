You are a sr typescript engineer that understands full stack architecture best practices for building cloud based applications with node, react, nextjs. Always check relevant documentation to verify any architectural changes follow best practies.

This repository is a small Electron + Next.js app (Mac menu bar) for tracking time by project.

Key facts for an AI code assistant working in this repo
- Big picture:
  - The app is an Electron shell with a Next.js renderer located in `src/renderer` and a TypeScript main process in `src/main`.
  - Runtime flow: main process (compiled to `dist/main`) boots Electron, registers a custom `app://` scheme (`src/main/protocol.ts`), creates the main window (`src/main/windows.ts`) and the tray (`src/main/tray.ts`).
  - The renderer is built with Next.js; production assets are served from `dist/renderer` via the `app://` handler.

- IPC / integration patterns (most important):
  - The preload script exposes a single global API at `window.tp` (`src/preload.ts`). All renderer ↔ main communication goes through this API and IPC channels prefixed with `tp:`.
  - IPC handlers live in `src/main/handlers` and are registered centrally in `src/main/handlers/index.ts` using `ipcMain.handle('tp:...', ...)`.
  - Service logic is implemented behind a singleton `ServiceManager` in `src/main/services/manager.ts` which constructs service objects (`project`, `company`, `task`, `session`) that wrap the DB layer.

- Data layer specifics:
  - A local SQLite DB (better-sqlite3) is created in the Electron `userData` directory by `src/main/services/data.ts` (class `DB`). The schema is created programmatically on startup.
  - The schema uses soft-delete via an `is_active` flag + `deleted_at` timestamps and DB triggers to keep `updated_at` in sync. Expect constraints and triggers in `createScema` in `data.ts`.
  - Native module note: `better-sqlite3` is rebuilt with `electron-rebuild` — `npm run rebuild:sqlite` (also run by `postinstall`, `prestart`, `prepackage`).

- Conventions & patterns to follow when editing or adding features:
  - IPC naming: use `tp:` prefix for channels (e.g. `tp:getProjectList`). Register handlers in `src/main/handlers/index.ts` and expose them in `src/preload.ts` under `window.tp` with matching names.
  - Services: obtain services via `ServiceManager.getInstance()`; prefer adding logic to a service (`src/main/services/*.ts`) rather than directly in handlers.
  - Models: types are declared with `*Model` suffix (e.g. `ProjectModel`, `TaskModel`) inside `src/main/services/*` — follow those shapes for IPC payloads.
  - UI → main flow: renderer calls `window.tp` (preload) → IPC channel → handler → service → `better-sqlite3` DB.

  - Important renderer dev-note: the renderer can run in isolation (Next dev) without the Electron preload. When editing renderer code, guard calls to `window.tp` (for example: `window.tp?.getTasks?.()` or `if (window?.tp) await window.tp.getTasks()`) to avoid runtime errors when the preload is absent. See `src/renderer/app/timer/page.tsx`, `src/renderer/app/configure/page.tsx` and `src/renderer/app/reports/page.tsx` for examples.

- Dev ergonomics additions (new in this branch):
  - Dev stub: `src/renderer/components/DevTPStub.tsx` provides an in-browser fake `window.tp` implementation for running the renderer standalone. It activates only when `window.tp` is not already present. Use it to prototype UI interactions without starting Electron.
  - Sidebar UI state persistence: The sidebar collapsed/expanded state is persisted using `localStorage` in the renderer. Use `useState` with a `useEffect` to read/write state, ensuring hydration consistency and persistence across navigation.
  - Sidebar SVG icons: For sidebar navigation, use inline SVG components with `fill="currentColor"` so icons inherit the parent color (active/inactive state). Icons and text are horizontally aligned with a small gap, and the gap disappears when collapsed. Do not use Next.js `Image` for SVGs if you need dynamic color changes. If using custom SVGs, ensure the path data matches the viewBox and is visible in the rendered area.
  - Electron/Next.js asset loading: When packaging, set `assetPrefix: 'app://-/'` in `next.config.js` so static assets resolve correctly via Electron's custom protocol.
  - UI state persistence: For simple per-user UI preferences (theme, sidebar, etc.), prefer `localStorage` in Electron renderer. Use React context only for session-scoped state sharing.
    - The stub sets `window.__TP_STUB_ACTIVE = true` so components can detect stub mode for UX hints.
  - Dev badge: `src/renderer/components/DevBadge.tsx` shows a small indicator when the stub is active. It uses `useEffect` and `useState` to check the stub flag after mount for reliable detection.
  - Guarded calls: renderer pages defensively call `window.tp` with optional chaining or runtime checks to avoid errors in standalone mode.
  - Select controls: All `<select>` elements use controlled `value` props. After loading from the DB, ensure all IDs (e.g., `company_id`) are numbers for correct selection. Avoid type sniffing in render; normalize data after load if needed.
  - NotifyBox: Use `NotifyBox` for in-app notifications (see `configure/page.tsx`).
  - DRY data loading: When loading companies/projects, use a shared async function (e.g., `loadSelectables`) to avoid duplication and ensure normalization.
  - Filtering and sorting patterns: For list/table views (e.g., `reports/page.tsx`), use `useMemo` to compute filtered and sorted data. Extract unique filter values from loaded data (e.g., companies). Implement column sorting with click handlers on table headers and show sort indicators (↑/↓). Use controlled inputs for filters (select dropdowns, date pickers) and apply filters + sort in a single `useMemo` for performance.
  - Toggle views and data aggregation: For reports that need multiple view modes (e.g., daily vs weekly), use state to toggle between modes and conditional logic in `useMemo` to aggregate data differently. Hide/show columns based on mode, adjust table headers dynamically, and handle date grouping (e.g., Monday-based weeks). Disable irrelevant filters when in aggregated modes.

- Build / dev / test workflows (concrete commands)
  - Dev renderer only: npm run dev:ui  (runs Next dev for `src/renderer`)
  - Full dev (build + Electron): npm run dev  (exports ENV=development and runs the start path)
  - Build for production: npm run build (cleans, builds renderer, runs `tsc`, copies svg assets)
  - Start packaged app locally after build: npm start  (calls `electron .` and expects `dist/main/index.js`)
  - Rebuild native sqlite binary (needed when switching node/electron or architecture): npm run rebuild:sqlite
  - Tests: npm test (Jest, renderer tests use jsdom; there are unit tests in `src/renderer/__tests__` and `src/renderer/lib/time.test.ts`)
  - Lint: npm run lint

- Packaging & assets
  - An `img/icon.icns` is used for packaging on macOS and is wired into the `package` script. The repo includes a helper `scripts/make-icon.sh` to generate an `.icns` from `img/logo.png` (macOS only). If CI needs to package on macOS, ensure `.icns` is present or the CI runs the script on macOS.
  - `package.json` has a `copy:assets` step to copy renderer SVGs and icon files into `dist` so the `app://` protocol can serve them.

- Small but important gotchas the assistant should surface in PRs / edits
  - `dist` must contain the renderer build for the `app://` protocol to serve static files. The `copy:assets` script copies SVGs (and icons) from `src/renderer`/`img` into `dist` after build.
  - Native module rebuild is required for `better-sqlite3`. CI/packaging must include `electron-rebuild` or run `npm run rebuild:sqlite`.
  - The DB initializer function is named `createScema` (note spelling) — search that exact name if tracing schema code.
  - Development-only CSP: to enable React Fast Refresh in Next dev the layout includes `'unsafe-eval'` in the CSP only when NODE_ENV === 'development'. Be cautious: do not copy that relaxed CSP to production.
  - For all select controls, ensure IDs are always numbers after loading from the DB. Normalize data in the loader, not in the render.
  - When updating arrays in React state, always use the functional update form (e.g., `setArr(prev => [...prev, item])`) to avoid mutation bugs.

- Quick how-to examples (minimal, concrete)
  - Add a new IPC handler: create `src/main/handlers/foo.ts` that returns a factory (services) => ({ myAction: (e, arg) => { ... } }); then import and wire it in `src/main/handlers/index.ts` with `ipcMain.handle('tp:myAction', fooHandler(services).myAction)` and expose a matching method in `src/preload.ts`.
  - Read/update DB: add logic to an existing service in `src/main/services/*` and call it from handlers; avoid putting SQL directly in handlers.
  - Renderer standalone dev: if you want to run `npm run dev:ui` and have the UI interact without Electron, rely on `DevTPStub` (it auto-attaches when `window.tp` is missing). When adding features that call `window.tp`, guard access with optional chaining or runtime checks so the code works both in Electron and in Next dev.

- Tests and test config notes
  - Jest is configured for the renderer using `jsdom` and uses `babel-jest`/`ts-jest` as needed for TSX. See `jest.config.ts` and `babel.config.js` in the repo. Renderer unit tests live under `src/renderer/__tests__` and use the `jsdom` environment.
